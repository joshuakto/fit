- Auto sync is now available ðŸŽ‰
- One-click to sync your vault
- Conflict resolution: Stores conflicting changes from remote in the local _fit folder so you can resolve conflicts after sync

# Quick demo


![Kapture 2024-03-15 at 17 37 07](https://github.com/joshuakto/fit/assets/34743132/27ea39b7-f54d-4c95-bf40-41972a29c26d)



## Setup
1. Create a personal access token with read/write access to the repo for your vault (refer to [Github: creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token))
2. Once the personal access token is filled in, you can authenticate the user. The GitHub username, list of repositories, and branches will auto-populate.
3. Select a repo and branch and you are ready to sync.

NOTE: For security, it's recommended to limit the token scope to only the necessary repository for your vault and avoid sharing your entire plugin settings file that contains this token.

## Notes about the first sync
- It is advised to use a new repo for syncing an existing vault, to minimize the chance of file name conflict on the first sync
- If your existing vault or repo is large, the initial sync would take longer and require a good internet connection

## Roadmap
1. Improve user notification
   - allow user to opt in to get list of file changes in Notice
2. Enable integration of other git tools (e.g. gitlab, gitea)

## Relevant plugins
There are other community plugins with more advanced git features, if you need features such as branching of your repo, [Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) is a nice plugin to check out.

There are also other plugins for synchronizing changes such as [Git integration](https://github.com/noradroid/obsidian-git-integration), [GitHub sync](https://github.com/kevinmkchin/Obsidian-GitHub-Sync), and [YAOS](https://github.com/mahyarmirrashed/yaos). However, they do not support mobile yet as of writing this plugin.
